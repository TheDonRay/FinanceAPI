This project is a simple Finance API tool designed to collect financial input from users—either through the CLI or through HTTP requests. It stores and updates this data in MongoDB, allowing you to maintain a persistent track record of your financial information. The API performs calculations based on the values you provide through the frontend and generates useful insights, including graphs that visualize your expenses and other financial metrics.
